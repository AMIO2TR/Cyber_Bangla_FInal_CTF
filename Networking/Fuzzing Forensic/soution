Fuzzing Forensics
Point: 100
You are tasked with identifying the specific tool utilized for directory fuzzing. Analyze the available data, logs, or system traces to pinpoint the exact tool employed in the fuzzing process."

Flag Format: CBCTF{name_name}
Solution: 
I know that gobuster is a fast and efficient brute-force tool primarily used for enumerating directories, files, DNS subdomains, and virtual hosts. 
So, I search the gobuster tool in chall (1).pcapng
Command: strings chal\ \(1\).pcapng|grep -i "gobuster" 
output: 
User-Agent: gobuster/3.6
User-Agent: gobuster/3.6
 
Then I find this ðŸ˜Ž
So, the flag is CBCTF{gobuster}
